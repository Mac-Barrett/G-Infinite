# G-Infinite
Attempting to create an FZero-like racing game using godot

This Project is going to slowly come together as I learn basic things inside this hellhole of a game engine.

Immediate todo list:

- Work on building wall bounce physics
- Creating more basic trackpieces so I can build a track
- Make an efficient way to link collision events of track pieces
  - Likely group them together somehow and run a for-loop? seems innefecient/costly

Eventual features I'd like to implement:

- CPU racers
- Trackbuilder functionality
  - More likely an array of ints, ints contain codes for trackpiece objects
  - Randomly assembly tracks via an algorithm
- Creating a machine like F-Zero GX
- Network play
  - On both pre-assembled tracks and created tracks
