# G-Infinite
Attempting to create an FZero-like racing game using godot

This Project is going to slowly come together as I learn basic things inside this hellhole of a game engine.

Current Features:

- Physics to bounce off of walls
- Laps & checkpoints
- Boost Pads
- Healing Strips
- Drag & Drop Style TrackBuilder
  - Contains enough unique trackpiece blocks to build suprisingly complex tracks
  - Complete with saving & loading custom tracks & track testing

Immediate todo list:

- Implement player boost button
- UI For Selecting pre-made tracks from a Cup system, i.e.: A Bronze Cup containing 5 races

Eventual features I'd like to implement:

- Much nicer general UX
- Improving the models, textures, & backgrounds
  - Honestly don't have the time nor modelling background to do this right now
- CPU racers
- Random Track Generator
- Creating custom racing machines like F-Zero GX
- Network play
  - MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE I'D LIKE TO EVENTUALLY ADD
