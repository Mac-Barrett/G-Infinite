# G-Infinite
Attempting to create an FZero-like racing game using godot

This Project is going to slowly come together as I learn basic things inside this hellhole of a game engine.

Immediate todo list:

- Implement player health bar
- Implement healing strips
- Implement player boost button
- Implement boost strips
- Creating more basic trackpieces so I can build a simple track
  - E.G. turns & integrating healing strips and boost strips onto pieces

Eventual features I'd like to implement:

- CPU racers
- Trackbuilder functionality
  - More likely an array of ints, ints contain codes for trackpiece objects
  - Randomly assembly tracks via an algorithm
- Creating a machine like F-Zero GX
- Network play
  - On both pre-assembled tracks and created tracks
